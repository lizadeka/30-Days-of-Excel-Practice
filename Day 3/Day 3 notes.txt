## ✅ Day 3: Excel Data Validation

Today I focused on data validation using a hands-on dataset:

1️⃣ Age must be between 18 and 65.
2️⃣ Salary must be a number between 30,000 and 200,000.
3️⃣ Start Date must be between Jan 1, 2020 and today.
4️⃣ Emails must contain '@' and '.' characters.
5️⃣ Department must use a dropdown list: HR, IT, Sales, Finance, Marketing.
6️⃣ Add an input message to Age column: 'Enter age between 18 and 65'.
7️⃣ Add an error alert to Salary column: 'Salary must be between 30,000 and 200,000'.
