✅ Day 2: Excel Data Cleaning & Preparation

Today I focused on cleaning and preparing raw data using built-in Excel features and formulas — a crucial step before any analysis.
🧹 Topics Practiced:
    ✅ Removing Duplicates
    → Used Remove Duplicates tool to clean up repeated entries
    → Applied it on full rows and specific columns (like Email or Employee ID)

    ✅ Trimming Extra Spaces
    → Used =TRIM(A2) to remove unwanted leading/trailing spaces
    → Ensured text values matched properly in lookups and filters

    ✅ Text Casing Fixes
    → Cleaned inconsistent names using:

        =PROPER(A2) – for capitalizing each word

        =UPPER() and =LOWER() – for consistent formatting across columns

    ✅ Fixing Negative Stock or Sales Values
    → Used =IF(A2<0, 0, A2) to replace invalid negative numbers with zero
    → Helped maintain data integrity during calculations

    ✅ Splitting Data into Columns
    → Used Text to Columns for fields like “City - Postal Code” 
    → Chose Delimited (by space)
